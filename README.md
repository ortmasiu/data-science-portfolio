# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio
This a Data Science Portfolio that consists of various Data Science and Machine Learning Projects that I have worked on in recent years. The projects in this repo are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks files. 

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

# Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

ML with Logistic Regression: Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
ML with K Nearest Neighbours: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems: A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.

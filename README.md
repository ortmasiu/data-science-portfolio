# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio
This a Data Science Portfolio that consists of various Data Science and Machine Learning Projects that I have worked on in recent years. The projects in this repo are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks files. 

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

# Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.
